To that end, a multiplicity of brain templates with anatomical annotations (i.e. atlases) have been published ( Dickie et al., 2017 ). However, a centralized resource that allows programmatic access to templates is lacking. TemplateFlow is a modular, version-controlled resource that allows researchers to use templates \"off-the-shelf\" and share new ones. The 7 templates highlighted in blue are constituents of the Montreal Neurological Institute (MNI) portfolio. The Waxholm space ( WHS ) and Fischer344 templates provide references for rat neuroimaging. fsaverage and fsLR are surface templates; the remaining templates are volumetric. Each template is distributed with atlas labels, segmentations, and metadata files. The 15 templates displayed here are only a small fraction of those created as stereotaxic references for the neuroimaging community. Please head over to our TemplateFlow Archive browser .

We're excited you're here and want to contribute. Imposter's syndrome disclaimer Imposter's syndrome disclaimer 1 : We want your help. No, really. There may be a little voice inside your head that is telling you that you're not ready to be an open-source contributor; that your skills aren't nearly good enough to contribute. What could you possibly offer a project like this one? We assure you - the little voice in your head is wrong. If you can write code at all, you can contribute code to open-source. Contributing to open-source projects is a fantastic way to advance one's coding skills. Writing perfect code isn't the measure of a good developer (that would disqualify all of us!); it's trying to create something, making mistakes, and learning from those mistakes. That's how we all improve, and we are happy to help others learn. Being an open-source contributor doesn't just mean writing code, either. You can help out by writing documentation, tests, or even giving feedback about the project (and yes - that includes giving feedback about the contribution process). Some of these contributions may be the most valuable to the project as a whole, because you're coming to the project with fresh eyes, so you can see the errors and assumptions that seasoned contributors have glossed over. Joining the conversation \u00b6 TemplateFlow is maintained by a growing group of enthusiastic developers\u2014 and we're excited to have you join! Most of our discussions will take place on open issues . We also encourage users to report any difficulties they encounter on NeuroStars , a community platform for discussing neuroimaging. We actively monitor both spaces and look forward to hearing from you in either venue! Before you start \u00b6 Are you allowed to share the template? \u00b6 Templates have a license to specify the terms under which they can be shared. TemplateFlow can only include templates that allow for redistribution. It is okay if the template requires attribution, but you need to make sure to add the attribution information into the template_description.json file. What type of contribution are you making? \u00b6 There are three different types of contributions you can make to TemplateFlow. A new template space : This contribution involves adding a new space that does not currently exist. Let us say you have made a new pediatric space that you transform your images to; this would be a new template space. All the different MNI templates are each considered their own template space. Currently this requires writing permissions to the TemplateFlow repo. For now, if you do not have access open up an issue in the templateflow repo to say which template spaces should be added. NIfTI images within an existing template space : This contribution involves adding to a template space that currently exists. An example of this would be adding a NIfTI file that is an atlas. You need to know which template space your atlas is in (Note: there are multiple MNI spaces). Meta information : This contribution involves additional information about existing templates. These will generally be in .json or .tsv files. There are also transform files which help translate between templates. Python client : You are implementing a new feature or fixing a bug of the Python client. Or you are improving its documentation. Please refer to the Python client area. There are tutorials for each of these different types of contributions. Template Style Guide \u00b6 Please check the documentation about how templates are structure and appropriate names for their files. Recognizing contributions \u00b6 We welcome and recognize all contributions regardless their size, content or scope: from documentation to testing and code development.

If you want to fix, improve or extend an existing template please refer to the Updating templates documentation (work in progress). This tutorial assumes you have read and understood the contributing guidelines . Overview: Submission pipeline and the TemplateFlow Manager tool \u00b6 To contribute a new template to TemplateFlow , members of the community first organise template resources to conform to the BIDS-like TemplateFlow structure. Next, the TemplateFlow Manager tool ( tfmgr ) synchronises the resources to OSF cloud storage and opens a new pull request proposing the addition of the new template. A subsequent peer-review process ensures that all data are conformant with the TemplateFlow standard. Finally, TemplateFlow curators conclude the peer-review process with the merge of the pull request, thereby adding the template into the TemplateFlow Archive . Step 1: Organize your template tree \u00b6 TemplateFlow follows a BIDS-like structure, please make sure your tree is formatted following the naming conventions . Examples Please check the formatting of existing templates in the Archive browser Step 2: Create a new public project at osf.io \u00b6 Head to your OSF home and create a new project.

The first time we run the above commands in python, we will see how the client connects to the archive and pulls down a copy. The second time the command is executed, the local copy is found and retrieved without further Internet access. Caution In computing environments isolated from the Internet (a common case on academic high-performance computing), please fetch all the templates you will need from the node where you can access the Internet during installation. TemplateFlow and Singularity Containers Singularity containers are a special case of isolated environment. These containers are usually executed without privileged permissions and on those settings, the default home folder (see below) will be non-writable. Please check fMRIPrep 's documentation for further information on how to use TemplateFlow within Singularity. The Python client in a nutshell \u00b6 Example usage of the Python client . After importing the API, the user submits a query for the T1-weighted FSL version of the MNI template at 1 mm resolution. The client first filters through the archive, identifies any files that match the query, and finds their counterparts in cloud storage. It then downloads the requested files and returns their paths in the local TemplateFlow installation directory. Future queries for the same resource can be completed without any re-downloading. Installation \u00b6 Before you start \u00b6 By default, the local cache of the archive is stored under $HOME/.cache/templateflow . If you need to change the location of the local copy, make sure you set the TEMPLATEFLOW_HOME environment variable: export TEMPLATEFLOW_HOME = /var/local/templateflow Please make sure you have read and write permissions on the folder you designate as home . Mode of operation \u00b6 The client can operate directly with DataLad or just download templates from a mirror of the archive stored on a public S3 bucket. Using the latter option rules out administering the local copy of the archive with DataLad. By default, the environment variable TEMPLATEFLOW_USE_DATALAD will be set to off . In other words, the default mode of operation is direct download. To enable the DataLad-base operation, make sure you set the environment variable: export TEMPLATEFLOW_USE_DATALAD = on Valid values for this environment variable to enable DataLad are 1 , y , on , yes , true . Installing the Python package with Pip \u00b6 The TemplateFlow Client only works with Python 3.6 or greater. $ python3 -m pip install templateflow Checking the installation \u00b6 $ python -c \"import templateflow as tf; print(tf.__version__)\" 0 .6.0 FAQ \u00b6 Custom (study / population specific) templates \u00b6 As Chris noted in this fundamental thread : Custom (volume and surface) templates derived from a particular dataset have been shown to improve overlap between participants. It is also the recommended way to deal with smaller head sizes in developmental populations. Both ANTs and FreeSurfer support building such templates. It is possible to integrate custom templates into TemplateFlow in two steps: Organize your template accordingly . Copy the custom template tree into the $TEMPLATEFLOW_HOME directory. Please make sure you include all the necessary files and resolutions that then will be utilized by downstream software. Why am I getting zero-sized NIfTI files? \u00b6 (From: templateflow/tpl-MNI152NLin2009cAsym#7 ) If you just installed TemplateFlow without explicitly setting the DataLad mode of operation on, then it will be using the S3 backend. To allow lazy loading, S3-operated client installations deploy an archive skeleton to the TemplateFlow Home directory. This skeleton contains zero-size files, that are replaced by the appropriate content pulled down from S3 on the first utilization. So, if you just installed the client, and want to open a particular template image with the Mango visualization tool, instead of just doing: $ mango ${ TEMPLATEFLOW_HOME :- $HOME /.cache/templateflow } /tpl-MNI152NLin6Asym/tpl-MNI152NLin6Asym_res-01_T1w.nii.gz Please make sure you use the client to access the image, for instance: $ mango $( python -c \"from templateflow.api import get; \\ print(str(get('MNI152NLin6Asym', resolution=1, suffix='T1w', desc=None, extension='nii.gz')))\" ) A pretty close behavior will be expected when operating in DataLad mode, although instead of getting zero-sized files, you'll probably get a straight file not found error.
